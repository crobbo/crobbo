## Welcome 👋 

Within these repositories you'll find a lot of code - the good, the bad and the ugly! 

In April 2020 I started The Odin Project and I have continued to do so whilst managing a full-time job. I am curently working through the Ruby on Rails section. Hopefully as you go through my repositories you can see my code quality improve! 

So far I have learnt about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Ruby, TDD, Databases and lots more. 

The standout highlight has been coding Ruby Command Line Chess. A real test that combined many different aspects of the Ruby course in to a final project.

*UPDATE 2021* - Started a new role as a software developer! Working with ASP.NET, C#, SQL, Vue.js, and more..

I'd love to hear from you - christian@christianrobinson.dev
